# Titanic Survival Prediction System

Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction System is a machine learning project that predicts whether a passenger would have survived the Titanic disaster based on selected features. The system is built using the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset from Kaggle and is deployed as a web-based application using Streamlit.

This project allows users to input passenger details and outputs whether the passenger Survived or Did Not Survive.

# Features Used

For model training, the following features from the dataset were selected:

Pclass – Passenger class (1, 2, 3)

Sex – Gender (male/female)

Age – Age of passenger

SibSp – Number of siblings/spouses aboard

Fare – Ticket fare

Target variable: Survived (1 = Survived, 0 = Did Not Survive)

# Machine Learning Algorithm

The project uses:

Random Forest Classifier – for predicting survival

Joblib – for saving and loading the trained model

StandardScaler – for feature scaling.



# Deployment

The app is deployed on Streamlit Cloud. The live URL can be found in Titanic_hosted_webGUI_link.txt.
